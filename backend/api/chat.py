"""
PHASE 5 - Chat API routes.

    POST /api/chat      ask a question
    GET  /api/status    which sources are connected

RESPONSE CONTRACT:
The response shape is fixed from the start and does not change as later phases
land. data_evidence, model_information, risk_score and risk_factors return null
today because those sources are not connected. When Phase 8 and Phase 9 arrive,
the same fields populate - no client change required.

Fields are never filled with placeholder values to make the response look
complete.
