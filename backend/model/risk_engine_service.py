PHASE 9 - Risk engine service.

Reads the EXISTING output of the platform's provider risk model. It contains no
scoring logic, and none should ever be added: if the assistant could compute a
score it would become a second, unvalidated detection engine and an investigator
could not tell which number came from where.

THE MODEL (per the platform's own metadata)
-------------------------------------------
Isolation Forest over 46 features, trained on 36,108 providers, bundled into a
weighted 0-100 Provider Risk Score:

    global anomaly    0.35    Isolation Forest, percentile-ranked
    peer deviation    0.30    specialty-peer z-scores
    service pattern           service-mix concentration
    geo deviation             state/national price benchmarks

Tiers: Low 0-29, Moderate 30-59, High 60-79, Critical 80-100.

The platform states plainly that no fraud ground-truth label exists or was used,
and that the model flags statistical anomalies rather than confirmed fraud. The
assistant's language reflects that.

RISK FACTORS
------------
The model does not emit named factors. It emits five peer-compared metrics, each
with the provider's value, peer median, percentile and deviation ratio. Those
ARE the factors, and they carry more evidence than a bare label would: a factor
here reads "payment per service is 4.2x the peer median (99th percentile)".

Factors are surfaced only when the metric is genuinely deviant (>=90th or <=10th
percentile). Reporting every metric regardless of deviation would bury the
signal.

    Model output, with the SOURCE of every score attached.

    WHY THE LABEL MATTERS
    Two different scores exist for the same provider:

      Provider_Risk_Score   from the provider risk model (Isolation Forest)
      overall_risk          from multi-agent synthesis, which BLENDS five
                            components - and the provider score is one of them,
                            weighted 0.30

    They legitimately differ. A provider extreme at the provider level but
    ordinary at the claim level scores high on the first and lower on the
    second. Their tier boundaries differ too, so the same case can read
    Critical under one and High under the other.

    Shown as bare numbers side by side, an investigator cannot tell which is
    which and may act on the wrong one. So every score carries `score_label`
    naming what produced it, and a synthesis score carries its component
    breakdown - because the breakdown is what explains the difference.
